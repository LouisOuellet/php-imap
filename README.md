## Description
phpIMAP is a PHP library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with IMAP email servers. It includes two main classes: the Message class and the Attachment class.

The Message class allows you to retrieve and manipulate email messages from an IMAP server. It provides methods for retrieving the message headers, body, and attachments, as well as for marking messages as read or deleted. Additionally, it includes a constructor method that takes an email message as its input and parses it into a Message object.

The Attachment class is used to handle email attachments. It includes methods for identifying the attachment's filename, type, and encoding, as well as for retrieving and saving the attachment's content. This class is typically used in conjunction with the Message class's getAttachments method, which retrieves all attachments associated with a given email message.

## Features
 - Retrieve email messages from IMAP servers
 - Get details of email messages such as sender, recipient, subject, date, and more
 - Get the body of email messages in plain text or HTML format

 - Move email messages to different mailboxes on the server
 - Search for email messages on the server based on various criteria such as sender, recipient, subject, and date
